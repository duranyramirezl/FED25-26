            <div class="storyblock">
                <p>
                    In 1960s Japan, teenager Shimizu Hinako lives in the small, remote town of Ebisugaoka,
                    nestled in a mountain pass. An average teen, she passes the time with nothing particularly
                    special about her life.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="storyblock">
                <p>
                    Until, that is, a deep fog descends on Ebisugaoka, and everything Hinako knows crumbles
                    as she finds her once-familiar home infested with spreading danger, the town empty except
                    for the horrors teeming in the fog.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, as she navigates the twisting paths of Ebisugaoka, Hinako must solve puzzles and
                    fight for her life in her struggle to survive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her struggle to reach the inevitable decision that must be made.
                    And her struggle to put an end to that which must be slain.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="storyblock">
                <p>
                    Will she choose to embrace elegance and beauty? Or will her path lead her to madness and
                    horror... A story of impossible decisions, of the beauty in terror, and terror from beauty.

                    <h3>Shimizu Hinako</h3>
                    <p>The game's main character.
                        A teenage girl struggling under the pressure of expectations from her friends, family, and
                        society.
                        Cheerful and energetic as a child, she's grown to become much more restrained, and now
                        hardly
                        smiles.</p>

                    <h3>Iwai Shu</h3>
                    <p>A childhood friend of Hinako's, they still call each other "partner," just like when they
                        were kids.
                        Forward-thinking for the time, he doesn't see anything wrong with friendships with the
                        opposite sex, and treats everyone alike.
                        His family have been physicians for generations, leaving him knowledgeable about various
                        medicines and treatments.</p>

                    <p>One of Hinako and Shu's friends. Tends to be a stickler for rules, and somewhat of a
                        busybody.
                        Quick to pick up on the latest rumors and gossip, and well-versed in matters of romance.
                        Has developed a bit of a crush on Shu.</p>

                        Her family manages the local Shinto shrine, so she helps with some of the ritual duties.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Ryushiki07 <span>Scriptwriter</span></h3>

                <p>To this day, I remember the feeling of my first encounter with the suffocating and oppressive
                    atmosphere
                    of SILENT HILL. It still deeply haunts me, and it still utterly fascinates me.
                    It's an honor to find myself involved with a series I have so many memories with. I've poured
                    all my
                    efforts into this story, so much so that I don't think I would mind if it was the last thing I
                    ever
                    wrote.</p>
                <p>To me, the SILENT HILL series is more than just a collection of stories, it's a medium; an
                    amazing,
                    phenomenal way of exploring and experiencing a person's heart and mind. It's my hope that
                    players
                    out
                    there will come to appreciate it in the same way.</p>
                <p>And to all of our overseas friends, I hope you'll enjoy a look at what SILENT HILL might be like
                    if
                    set
                    somewhere a little different, like Japan.</p>

                <h3>Kera <span> Creature & Character Design</span></h3>
                <p>I love the SILENT HILL series, and it's been a big influence on me.
                    In particular, I am constantly remembering SILENT HILL 2, and the messages on the walls, the
                    music,
                    and the monster designs.</p>
                <p>So, when it came to SILENT HILL f, and bringing the setting to Japan, we had to come up with
                    something that felt just a little different, and I had to really think about how to get that
                    feeling.
                    The monster designs were the hardest. I had to consider everything that's come in SILENT HILL
                    before, and figure out how to take this game in a different direction, but still be SILENT HILL.
                    It might not be the exact same blood-smeared, rusting scenery, but I sincerely hope you'll enjoy
                    our
                    vision and the world we've created.</p>

                <h3>Konatsu Kato <span>Actress</span></h3>
                <p>My name is Konatsu Kato, and I play Hinako Shimizu in SILENT HILL f. I feel truly lucky to have
                    gotten to play a part in this game, and this story set in Japan.
                    I've been living as Hinako in the world of SILENT HILL for a long time, now. I almost felt my
                    own
                    sanity slipping at times, but it was all worth it to be able to contribute to this game.
                    By the time you read this, it shouldn't be much longer until the game's in your hands, and I'm
                    so,
                    so excited for all of you to get to play it. Thank you all, so much.</p>

                <h3>Yuuka Iijima <span>Actress</span></h3>
                <p>I’m Yuuka Iijima, and I played Nishida Rinko in SILENT HILL f.
                    I still remember clearly how nervous and excited I was when I first got the script, and the
                    sound of
                    my heart pounding in my ears. Even though I was worried at first about how to play a character
                    that
                    was so totally new to me, the more I got to know Rinko the more she felt like a part of me.</p>
                <p>I’m still so very proud to be a part of such a worldwide phenomenon like SILENT HILL, and I’m
                    glad I
                    get to be part of introducing this story set in Japan to so many people.</p>

                <h3>Eri Goda <span>Voice actor</span></h3>
                <p>When I think of SILENT HILL, I always picture a damp and disorienting world, where you always
                    seem to
                    feel unsettled and isolated. SILENT HILL f is obviously no exception, so I had to keep reminding
                    myself that despite all that, Sakuko is someone who tries not to let it get her down. Things do
                    take
                    a pretty dark turn in the second half, but I’m grateful I got the chance to perform such a
                    variety
                    of emotions and scenes.</p>
                <p>I can’t wait for the game to come out so everyone can drink in the Japanese atmosphere dripping
                    from
                    every corner, see all the enchanting but disturbing monsters, and witness the fate of our
                    characters.</p>
